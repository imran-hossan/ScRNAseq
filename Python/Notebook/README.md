I conducted an end-to-end scRNA-seq analysis using Scanpy on a sample from GSE208652. The workflow was executed with mostly default parameters, and I did not target any specific biological questions during the analysis. The raw data can be downloaded from here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE208653. The notebook is in the Notebook folder named practice.ipynb
